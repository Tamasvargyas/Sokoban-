# Sokoban-
While learning C in University we all had to create our own projects. I chose to recreate the classic game "Sokoban" as my project.
If you intend to run the game I suggest you download Code::Blocks IDE (http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) as that makes running the code easy. The whole project can be opened in the installed Ide by opening the "sokoban.cbp" file (contained in "sokoban.zip"). To run the game you also have to install the correct SDL Graphics package (https://infoc.eet.bme.hu/sdl_telepito/sdl2-codeblocks1712-windows.zip) and assign its contents to the Code::Blocks Ide. More help on that (in hungarian) here: https://infoc.eet.bme.hu/sdl_telepito/
